## Getting Started

After cloning the project, get started with:

    npm install && npm test

`npm test` will lint the code and run tests.

## Testing

Add test cases for what could be "more poetic" to
`test/PreferPoetModeTest.coffee`

Running `npm test` will both lint your code (using the code you are
developing) and run tests.

CircleCI is hooked up, and you can see the latest here:
