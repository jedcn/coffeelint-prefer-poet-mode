# coffeelint-prefer-poet-mode

This project has been restarted as
[coffeelint-prefer-fewer-parens][github-prefer-fewer-parens], and
prefer-fewer-parens has been published
[on npm][npm-prefer-fewer-parens].

The spirit of the project lives on:

    Provide a CoffeeLint rule to aid in writing CoffeeScript such that
    you more commonly rely on "implicit parens" instead of explicit
    parens.

Happy Coding,

:metal:
